## üé™ Introduction
In the transformative epoch of the **digital revolution**, **fintech startups** like **Lending Club** are pioneering a democratization of credit access. Being an online peer-to-peer lending platform, Lending Club is the linchpin connecting borrowers, often sidelined by traditional banking systems, with investors exploring diverse investment landscapes. However, every frontier has its challenges - here, it's loan defaults. This project is oriented towards the creation of a **predictive model**...

## üåê Understanding of Business
From the vantage point of an economist, Lending Club's model stands as an innovative panacea for credit market anomalies, often overshadowing traditional banks and financial institutions. Lending Club harnesses a multitude of data points - personal facets, credit history, loan purpose, and beyond - to accurately gauge the **creditworthiness** of loan applicants, an essential aspect in the mitigation of loan default risks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Business Objectives
This project sets its sights on enhancing Lending Club's risk assessment efficiency and fortifying the overall resilience of the peer-to-peer lending sector. The precise objectives are:

1. üéõÔ∏è Devise a robust machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan default.
2. üéØ Pinpoint the key factors precipitating loan defaults.
3. üí° Impart actionable insights to fine-tune Lending Club's risk assessment process.
4. üìà Ultimately, trim down the number of loan defaults, bolster investor confidence, and boost the platform's profitability.

By realizing these objectives, we can aid Lending Club in fostering a balanced financial ecosystem where credit access is broadened, risks are adeptly managed, and profitability is ensured. This aligns with the overarching economic goal of financial inclusivity and stability in the lending arena.

- Top 3 models with default parameters:

|    | Classifier    | Data   |   Accuracy |   Precision |   Recall |   F1-score |   ROC AUC |   Brier_score |
|---:|:--------------|:-------|-----------:|------------:|---------:|-----------:|----------:|--------------:|
|  0 | Xg-boost      | Test   |   0.80349  |    0.813589 | 0.978714 |   0.888545 |  0.539887 |      0.19651  |
|  1 | sgd           | Test   |   0.800175 |    0.815147 | 0.970383 |   0.886017 |  0.544117 |      0.199825 |
|  2 | random_forest | Test   |   0.771082 |    0.830677 | 0.896773 |   0.862461 |  0.581996 |      0.228918 |

**The final model used for this project: Xg-boost**
- **Metrics used: Recall and Bri-scores**
- **Why choose recall as metrics**:
During a bear market, like the current economic situation, lenders become more cautious and conservative in granting credit or loans. The primary objective is to minimize the risk of default. In this context, the choice of evaluation metrics for model selection is crucial.

- The Brier score: It measures the accuracy and calibration of the model's predicted probabilities. A lower Brier score indicates that the model's predictions align well with the actual outcomes, providing reliable estimates of loan default probabilities.

- Recall: It focuses on capturing the true positives, which are the actual loan defaults. A high Recall value implies that the model effectively identifies a significant proportion of defaulters.

  Considering both the Brier score and Recall, lenders can select a model that exhibits accurate predictions (low Brier score) while ensuring a high sensitivity in capturing loan defaults (high Recall). This enables lenders to make informed decisions, protect their investments, and reduce potential losses during challenging economic conditions.

  ## Limitations and Potential Improvements

To further enhance the loan approval prediction model for lending clubs, several considerations and potential improvements can be explored:

1. Integration with Regression Model: Combining the current classification model with a regression model can provide additional insights into predicting the loan amount that an applicant is likely to be approved for. This would offer a more comprehensive assessment of the loan approval process.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizing advanced techniques such as grid search or random search can help optimize the model's hyperparameters. By systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameters, we can identify the best configuration that maximizes the model's performance.

3. Feature Selection and Retraining: Conducting further analysis to identify the least predictive features and removing them from the model can improve its efficiency and accuracy. Retraining the model on the refined feature set would ensure a more focused and relevant prediction capability.

These potential improvements aim to refine the model's predictive power, increase its interpretability, and enhance the overall performance in accurately predicting loan approvals for lending clubs.
